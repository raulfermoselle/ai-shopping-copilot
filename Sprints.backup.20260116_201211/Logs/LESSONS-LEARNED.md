## Lesson Entry Template

```markdown
### LL-XXXX: [Title]

**Source**: Sprint-XX, Task XX
**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
**Category**: [AI Collaboration / Development / Process / Technical]

**Context**:
[What situation led to this learning]

**Lesson**:
[The key insight or pattern]

**Evidence**:
[What happened that demonstrated this]

**Action Taken**:
- [ ] Documented only (pattern not recurring enough)
- [ ] Incorporated into policy: [policy name]
- [ ] Created new guideline
- [ ] Updated existing process

**Evaluation Criteria Score**:
| Criterion | Score |
|-----------|-------|
| Recurrence | Low / Medium / High |
| Impact | Low / Medium / High |
| Generalizability | Low / Medium / High |
| Actionability | Low / Medium / High |

*Note: Score 3+ High to incorporate into policies*
```

## Incorporation Guidelines

### When to Add to Policies

A lesson should be incorporated into policies when it scores HIGH on 3+ criteria:

1. **Recurrence**: Has this occurred multiple times?
2. **Impact**: Did it cause significant delays/failures?
3. **Generalizability**: Does it apply beyond this sprint?
4. **Actionability**: Can it be expressed as a clear rule?

### Complexity Balance

- Total policy lines must stay under 2000
- When adding rules, consider consolidating existing rules
- Quarterly review to prune obsolete rules
