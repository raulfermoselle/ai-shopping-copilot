## Instructions

- Mark items complete with `[x]`
- Add inline comments after items if needed
- Reference CHK numbers for tracking
- This checklist integrates with sprint validation

## Requirements Checklist

> Validate specification completeness before planning.

### User Story Quality
- [x] CHK001: Each user story follows "As a... I want... So that..." format
- [x] CHK002: All user stories have clear priority (P1/P2/P3)
- [x] CHK003: Each story has acceptance scenarios
- [x] CHK004: Stories are independently testable
- [x] CHK005: No story exceeds sprint capacity

### Functional Requirements
- [x] CHK006: All requirements are measurable/verifiable
- [x] CHK007: Requirements trace to user stories
- [x] CHK008: No implementation details in requirements
- [x] CHK009: Edge cases documented
- [x] CHK010: Error scenarios defined

### Success Criteria
- [x] CHK011: Metrics are technology-agnostic
- [x] CHK012: Targets are specific and measurable
- [x] CHK013: Timeframes defined for business KPIs
- [ ] CHK014: Baseline values documented - *Baseline for cart abandonment unknown*

## Feature-Specific Checks

> Additional validation for this feature.

### Extension Architecture
- [x] CHK-EXT001: Feature uses existing adapters (no Chrome imports in core)
- [x] CHK-EXT002: State machine states defined (no checkout/payment states)
- [x] CHK-EXT003: Content script extractors identified
- [x] CHK-EXT004: Service worker recovery considered

### Safety Constraints
- [x] CHK-SAF001: Specification explicitly excludes checkout automation
- [x] CHK-SAF002: No paths to payment in state machine
- [x] CHK-SAF003: User must manually complete order

### User Experience
- [x] CHK-UX001: Progress feedback defined for all states
- [x] CHK-UX002: Error messages are user-friendly
- [x] CHK-UX003: Login state clearly communicated
- [x] CHK-UX004: Results include actionable next steps

## Notes

### Pending Items

**CHK014 - Baseline values**: Cart abandonment baseline not measured. This is acceptable for MVP - will measure after initial deployment.

### Decisions Made During Review

1. **Order selection**: Decided against user-selectable orders - always merge last 3
2. **Cart clearing**: First order replaces cart to ensure clean state
3. **Retry policy**: 2 automatic retries before showing error to user
