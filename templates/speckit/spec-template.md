## 1. User Stories & Journeys

> Each user story MUST be independently testable to ensure viable MVP development.

### Story Priority Levels
- **P1**: Core functionality - Required for MVP
- **P2**: Enhanced functionality - Improves user experience
- **P3**: Nice-to-have - Future enhancement

### User Story: [US1] [Story Title]

**Priority**: P1

**As a** [actor/role]
**I want** [action/capability]
**So that** [benefit/outcome]

**Why this priority?**: [Business justification]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

| Scenario | Given | When | Then |
|----------|-------|------|------|
| Happy path | [Initial state] | [User action] | [Expected outcome] |
| Edge case | [Alternative state] | [User action] | [Alternative outcome] |
| Error case | [Error condition] | [User action] | [Error handling] |

**Independent Testing Approach**:
- Can be developed without: [list dependencies that can be mocked]
- Requires: [list hard dependencies]
- Test data: [describe test data requirements]

---

### User Story: [US2] [Story Title]

**Priority**: P2

[Repeat structure above]

---

## 2. Functional Requirements

> Focus on WHAT the system must do, not HOW it will be implemented.

### Core Capabilities

| ID | Requirement | User Story | Testable Criteria |
|----|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| FR001 | [Capability description] | US1 | [How to verify] |
| FR002 | [Capability description] | US1, US2 | [How to verify] |

### Business Rules

| ID | Rule | Applies To | Exception |
|----|------|------------|-----------|
| BR001 | [Business rule] | [Context] | [Exception case] |

---

## 3. Key Entities

> Define data concepts without implementation details.

### Entity: [Entity Name]

**Description**: [What this entity represents]

**Attributes**:
| Attribute | Description | Required | Constraints |
|-----------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| [name] | [description] | Yes/No | [validation rules] |

**Relationships**:
- [Entity] has many [Related Entity]
- [Entity] belongs to [Parent Entity]

**State Transitions** (if applicable):
```
[State1] --[Action]--> [State2] --[Action]--> [State3]
```

---

## 4. Edge Cases & Error Scenarios

| Scenario | Trigger | Expected Behavior | User Story |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| [Edge case name] | [What causes it] | [System response] | US1 |
| [Error scenario] | [Error condition] | [Error handling] | US2 |

---

## 5. Success Criteria

> Technology-agnostic, measurable outcomes.

### User Metrics
| Metric | Target | Measurement Method |
|--------|--------|-------------------|
| [Metric name] | [Specific target] | [How measured] |

### System Performance
| Metric | Target | Acceptable Range |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Response time | [target] | [range] |
| Availability | [target] | [range] |

### Business Impact
| KPI | Baseline | Target | Timeframe |
|-----|----------|--------|-----------|
| [KPI name] | [current value] | [target value] | [when measured] |

## 6. Out of Scope

> Explicitly list what is NOT included in this feature.

- [Item 1]: [Why excluded]
- [Item 2]: [Why excluded]

---

## 7. Clarifications

> Record all clarifications and decisions made during specification.

### [DATE] - Initial Clarifications

- **Q**: [Question that was asked]
  **A**: [Answer/Decision made]
  **Impact**: [Which section was updated]

---

## 8. Sprint Integration

> Maps this specification to sprint execution.

### Estimated Effort
| Component | Story Points | Sprint Capacity |
|-----------|-------------|-----------------|
| US1 Implementation | [points] | [% of sprint] |
| US2 Implementation | [points] | [% of sprint] |
| Testing | [points] | [% of sprint] |
| **Total** | [total] | [total %] |

### Sprint Allocation Recommendation
- **Single Sprint**: If total <= 70% sprint capacity
- **Multi-Sprint**: Break by user story priority
  - Sprint N: US1 (P1 stories)
  - Sprint N+1: US2 (P2 stories)

### Dependencies on Other Sprints
| Dependency | Sprint | Status |
|------------|--------|--------|
| [What's needed] | [Sprint ID] | [Status] |
